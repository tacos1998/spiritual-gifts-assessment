# Spiritual Gifts Assessment

Online tool to help you discern your spiritual gifts and how to use them, built with Vite + React + TypeScript.

I am the Director of Music, Technology Specialist, and a member of the Parish Leadership Team at [Saint Peter Catholic Church in Mary Esther, FL.](https://www.saintpeter.me/) Our Team decided that we wanted to design and promote a spiritual gifts assessment for our parishioners. There exist many print and digital versions of spiritual assessments, but our Team wanted to create our own customized version to better suit our congregation. There also exist many online quiz/personality test builders, but for our use case, they all require paid plans. So I leveraged my knowledge of Vite, React, and TypeScript to build our own digital assessment in-house.

This assessment was designed specifically with our congregation in mind, but it is useful for anyone wishing to learn more about their spiritual gifts. If you want to customize your own version of this assessment, you can clone the repo and edit the questions and categories to your liking.
